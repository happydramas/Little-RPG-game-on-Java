The main idea of my project is to create a simple choice of answer game that allows you to develop the game's plot. 
Although the plot is short in itself, the main goal was to show the skill of using our Java skills. 
The concept of the game was based on traditional Japanese RPG games, as well as games like Beyond Two Souls, Heavy Rain, etc. I worked on this project alone.
 
	Since my game turned out to be quite small, there was no need to store a lot of information. For this reason, there are only two tables in my database. 
  The first table shows the successes of the players who have already tried to complete the given game. 
  The second table is needed in order to show information about the things that are in your inventory, 
  thus this table is directly related to the game and the inventory itself interacts in the game. 
  As a result, in my database there are two tables that are not related to each other, but the information that the game provides or that is needed for the game itself is used.
